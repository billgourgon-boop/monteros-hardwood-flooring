    body: `Solid hardwood is the original flooring choice — and still the right one for raised-foundation homes, formal living spaces, and homeowners planning to stay long-term.

## What makes it solid

A single piece of hardwood, 3/4 inch thick, milled with tongue-and-groove edges. Same wood top to bottom, which means it can be sanded and refinished 4 to 7 times over its lifetime.

## Where it shines

- **Raised foundations** in older San Bernardino, Redlands, and Riverside neighborhoods.
- **Long-term homes** where the next refinish is part of the plan.
- **Historic homes** where solid wood is the right aesthetic.
- **Narrow to medium plank widths** (2-1/4" to 5"), where stability is excellent.

## Where to be cautious

- **Slab subfloors** — solid hardwood can\'t be installed directly to concrete. Engineered or LVP is the move on most newer Inland Empire homes.
- **Wide planks above 5"** in our climate — humidity swings make wider solid planks more prone to cupping. Engineered handles wider widths better here.

## What we install

Domestic oak (red and white), hickory, maple, and select premium species. Most installs are 3-1/4" to 5" wide with site-finished or pre-finished options.

    body: `Engineered hardwood combines a real wood wear layer with a multi-ply plywood core. The result: real hardwood looks and feel, with much better dimensional stability than solid.

## How it\'s made

A 1 – 6 mm wear layer of real hardwood is bonded to a 5 – 7 ply plywood or HDF core. Total thickness usually 1/2" to 5/8".

## Where it wins

- **Slab subfloors** — the dominant subfloor in Fontana, Ontario, newer Rancho Cucamonga, and most post-1990 Inland Empire construction.
- **Wide planks (5" – 9")** — the plywood core resists movement, so wide-plank engineered stays flat where solid would cup.
- **Variable humidity rooms** — kitchens and basements (where present) handle engineered better.

## What to ask about wear-layer thickness

The wear-layer thickness in millimeters is the number that matters:
- **1 – 2 mm**: budget grade. Cannot be refinished. Plan to replace in 15 – 20 years.
- **3 – 4 mm**: mid-grade. 1 – 2 light refinishes possible.
- **4 – 6 mm**: premium grade. Refinishes like solid, lasts 30 – 50 years.

We bring engineered samples with documented wear-layer specs to every estimate.

## Common pairings

Engineered wide-plank European oak in living/dining + LVP in wet rooms is one of our most-quoted whole-house plans across the Inland Empire today.

## What makes it different

- **Width.** 6", 7", 8", and 9" planks dominate. Modern proportions, fewer seams.
- **Grain character.** European oak has tighter grain and more figure than domestic oak. Available in clean grades and "character" grades with knots and mineral streaks.
- **Custom finishes.** Wire-brushed, hand-scraped, smooth. Stain options from pure white-washed to deep walnut.
- **Engineered construction.** Almost always engineered for stability at these widths.

## Pricing window

Premium European oak runs $14 – $22+ per square foot installed. The price is real — but so is the look. We bring samples in multiple widths and finishes to every estimate.

## Care notes

Wider planks expand and contract more in absolute terms with humidity. A whole-house humidifier on HVAC keeps indoor humidity in the 35 – 50% band — non-negotiable for wide-plank longevity in our climate.

## Red oak

- **Reddish-pink undertone.** Warmer cast, especially with natural finish.
- **Open grain pattern.** Visible grain, takes stain unevenly compared to white oak.
- **Slightly softer** than white oak (Janka 1290 vs 1360).
- **More affordable** — typically the budget-friendly oak option.

## White oak

- **Cooler, browner undertone.** Modern preference. Takes grey, white-washed, and natural finishes beautifully.
- **Tighter grain pattern.** Cleaner look, takes stain more evenly.
- **Slightly harder** than red oak.
- **Premium pricing** — typically 10 – 20% more than red oak.

## Which we recommend in 2026

70% of our hardwood installs today are white oak. The cooler tone matches contemporary interiors, the grain pattern photographs better, and clients often prefer it once they see both species side-by-side.

That said, red oak is still excellent and the right choice in homes where it matches existing trim, doors, or cabinetry — common in 1970s and 1980s Inland Empire homes.

## Cost

- Red oak: $8 – $12 per sq ft installed
- White oak: $10 – $15 per sq ft installed
- Wide-plank white oak: $13 – $18+ per sq ft installed

    body: `Hickory is for homeowners who want maximum durability and big visual character. About 10% of our hardwood installs.

## Why pick hickory

- **Hardness.** Janka 1820 — 41% harder than red oak, 33% harder than white oak. Resists dents from dropped objects and pet activity.
- **Color variation.** Each plank has a wide range from creamy sapwood to dark walnut-toned heartwood. Dramatic.
- **Grain.** Pronounced, often with visible knots and mineral streaks. Rustic, character-rich.

## Where it fits best

- **Entryways and high-traffic homes** — the hardness pays off.
- **Mountain or rustic interiors** — character grain matches the aesthetic.
- **Cabin-style or craftsman homes** — feels right.

## Where to think twice

- **Modern minimalist interiors** — character grain may feel busy.
- **Spaces where uniform color matters** — the natural variation can\'t be controlled.
- **Tight budgets** — hickory runs $11 – $16 per sq ft installed, similar to white oak.

## Maintenance notes

Same as oak — hardwood-specific cleaner only, felt pads under furniture, humidity in the 35 – 50% band. The hardness means scratches that would mar oak often don\'t register on hickory.

    alt: 'Waterproof luxury vinyl plank flooring',
    parentService: 'luxury-vinyl-plank',
    body: `Waterproof LVP is the single most-installed flooring in the Inland Empire today. Here\'s why and what to look for.

## What makes it truly waterproof

The key is the core construction. Stone Polymer Composite (SPC) and Wood Polymer Composite (WPC) cores are dimensionally stable when wet — they don\'t swell, warp, or delaminate.

## SPC vs WPC

- **SPC** — denser, harder, more impact-resistant. Better for high-traffic and commercial.
- **WPC** — softer underfoot, slightly warmer feel, often a touch quieter. Better for residential comfort.

Most quality residential LVP today is SPC with an attached cork or foam pad for comfort.

## Where it shines

- **Bathrooms** — full bathrooms with showers and tubs. Yes, the floor itself.
- **Kitchens** — dishwasher leaks, refrigerator condensation, dropped pots.
- **Laundry rooms** — washing machine overflow, sock drips.
- **Pet households** — accidents wipe up, no damage.
- **Mudrooms and entryways** — wet shoes and rainy days.

## What to ask about

- **Wear layer thickness in mils** (1/1000 inch). 12 mil is residential grade. 20+ mil is commercial. Pet households should target 20 mil.
- **Total plank thickness** — 5 mm minimum for residential rigid-core.
- **Edge treatment** — micro-beveled or square edge. Beveled looks more like real wood.
- **Pad attached** — yes; eliminates a separate underlayment step.

## Pricing

$5 – $9 per sq ft installed for quality waterproof LVP. Premium options with thicker wear layers, larger plank sizes, and embossed-in-register textures run higher.

    parentService: 'luxury-vinyl-plank',
    body: `SPC stands for Stone Polymer Composite — a rigid LVP core made from limestone powder and stabilizers. It\'s the densest, most dimensionally stable LVP option.

## Why SPC

- **Hardest LVP core.** Resists dents from dropped objects better than WPC or older flexible LVP.
- **Most dimensionally stable.** Doesn\'t expand or contract with temperature swings — important in our climate.
- **Goes over imperfect subfloors** — minor lumps and bumps don\'t telegraph through.
- **Fully waterproof.** Same as other quality rigid-core LVP.

## When to choose SPC over WPC

- High-traffic households, kids, large dogs.
- Heavy furniture (pianos, large couches) that you want to roll across.
- Homes with marginal subfloor flatness.
- Commercial-feel-and-durability without commercial pricing.

## When WPC might be better

- Sensitive feet (older homeowners) — WPC is softer underfoot.
- Quieter underfoot priority — WPC has a slightly warmer acoustic profile.
- Tight budget — basic WPC sometimes runs slightly less than SPC.

Both are excellent. We bring both to every LVP estimate.

## Pricing

$5 – $9 per sq ft installed. Wear-layer thickness drives price more than core type.

## How it goes down

1. **Subfloor prep.** Clean, flat (within 3/16" over 10 ft), dry. Self-leveler for low spots.
2. **Underlayment** if not pad-attached. Most quality LVP today has the pad attached.
3. **Layout planning.** Random plank placement, expansion gap at every wall.
4. **Click and lay.** Each plank locks into the next via the precision edge profile.
5. **Trim and transitions.** Quarter-round, baseboards, transition strips at other flooring.

## Why click-lock

- **Fast.** Whole-house in 1 – 3 days.
- **Forgiving.** Floats over many imperfections that would telegraph through glue-down.
- **No off-gassing wait.** Walk on it the same day.
- **Removable.** If you need to access subfloor under a board, pull it up, fix, click back.
- **Goes over existing tile, vinyl, and laminate** in many cases — saves a demo day.

## When glue-down makes more sense

- Commercial spaces with rolling traffic.
- Very large open spaces (over 1,500 sq ft continuous) where movement could be visible.
- Wet areas with frequent standing water risk.
- Stairs (always glued).

- **AC2** — moderate residential. Bedrooms and dining rooms.
- **AC3** — heavy residential / light commercial. Most "good enough" residential laminate.
- **AC4** — heavy residential / commercial. Family homes with kids and pets.

## What we recommend

- **Casual single household, low traffic:** AC3 minimum.
- **Family with kids and pets:** **AC4 minimum.** No exceptions.
- **Rental property:** AC4.
- **Commercial space:** AC5.

We don\'t install AC1 or AC2 — the lifespan math doesn\'t work for any household paying us to install professionally.

## What AC ratings don\'t cover

- Water resistance (separate spec — see [water-resistant laminate](/flooring/water-resistant-laminate/)).
- Realistic visuals (separate from durability).
- Edge bevel and texture quality.
- Underlayment quality (you choose this separately).

## Why we lean AC4 for almost everyone

The price difference between AC3 and AC4 is small — usually under $0.50 per sq ft at the material level. The lifespan difference is real. If you\'re paying for professional installation, the math always favors AC4.

    body: `"Dustless" is a marketing word. The reality: nothing is truly dust-free, but modern dust-containment systems capture 95%+ of airborne dust at the source. Compared to open sanding, the difference is night and day.

## How it works

Our drum and edge sanders connect to high-CFM HEPA vacuum systems via sealed hoses. As the sander cuts, dust is pulled into the vacuum the moment it\'s generated — before it has a chance to spread.

## What you actually experience

- **Light residual dust** on hard surfaces in adjacent rooms.
- **Far less dust on furniture** than the old way.
- **Air quality** in your home is dramatically better during and after.
- **Cleanup time** at the end of the job is shorter.

## What it doesn\'t eliminate

- Some fine dust always escapes — particularly during edge sanding in corners.
- Stain and finish chemical odors are unrelated to dust.
- Settled dust on horizontal surfaces in adjacent rooms (we wipe down at end of job).

## Worth the cost

Dust-contained systems cost more in equipment and consumables than open sanding. We don\'t charge separately — it\'s our standard process. Old-school open sanding contractors who sand without containment are increasingly rare and the dust difference is enormous.

## Other refinishing-related health considerations

- **Oil-based polyurethane** off-gasses for several days.
- **Water-based polyurethane** is much lower VOC, faster cure, milder smell. Our default for sensitive households.
- **Stain options** vary in VOC content — we discuss during estimate.

- **Floor has been refinished within 5 – 10 years** and the finish is just tired.
- **You want to extend finish life without the cost of full refinishing.**
- **Pet households where the floor needs more frequent refresh than full refinish allows.**

## What it doesn\'t fix

- Scratches deep enough to expose bare wood.
- Stain damage.
- Color change requests.
- Cupping or board damage.
- Significant dents or gouges.

For any of those, a full refinish (sand-stain-seal) is the right move.

## Process

1. Vacuum and clean the floor thoroughly.
2. Light screen-sand with a buffer + screen pad.
3. Vacuum and tack-cloth.
4. Apply 1 – 2 coats of fresh polyurethane.
5. Walk-on after 24 hours; furniture after 5 days.

## Cost

$1.50 – $3 per sq ft. Roughly half to one-third the cost of full refinishing.

## Frequency

Most well-maintained hardwood floors benefit from screen-and-recoat every 5 – 8 years. It can extend the time between full refinishes by years and adds significant total floor life.

## Step-by-step

1. **Floor inspection.** Thickness check, board condition, repair list.
2. **Repairs and board replacement** before sanding starts.

8. **Full stain application.**
9. **Sealer coat.**
10. **2 – 3 finish coats** with light screening between coats.
11. **Final inspection and walk-through.**

## Stain choices

- **Natural** (no stain) — clearcoat over bare wood. Lets the wood\'s natural color show.
- **Light** — soft tan, white-washed, beige tones. Modern.
- **Medium** — natural oak tones, cinnamon, light walnut. Classic.
- **Dark** — espresso, ebony, dark walnut. Dramatic.
- **Custom blends** — we can match a specific color from a sample you provide.

## Finish choices

- **Water-based polyurethane** — low VOC, fast cure, slightly cooler color. Default for sensitive households and modern aesthetics.
- **Oil-based polyurethane** — slightly warmer (amber) color, more depth, longer cure. Traditional.
- **Hard wax oil** — penetrating finish, more European feel, requires more maintenance.

## Timeline

- **Days 1 – 2:** sanding.
- **Days 2 – 3:** stain and first coats.
- **Days 3 – 5:** finish coats.
- **Walkable** after 24 hours from final coat.

- **HVAC condensate** — overflow pan failure on attic units leaks through ceiling.

## The damage progression

- **Hour 0 – 4:** floor surface is wet but recoverable if dried fast.
- **Hour 4 – 24:** water has penetrated wood. Cupping likely.
- **Day 1 – 7:** discoloration and staining set in. Some recovers; some permanent.
- **Day 7+:** mold risk. Subfloor damage likely.

## What we do

1. **Assess damage extent.** How many boards? How deep? Is the subfloor wet?
2. **Identify and fix water source** if not already done.
3. **Dry the area aggressively** — fans, dehumidifier, moisture meters.
4. **Replace damaged boards** with matching species, grade, and stain.
5. **Treat subfloor** if needed — sometimes light remediation, sometimes section replacement.
6. **Refinish surrounding area** to blend repair with existing floor.

## What\'s usually salvageable

- **Surface staining** that hasn\'t penetrated deep — often refinishes out.
- **Light cupping** that flattens after thorough drying — often saved.
- **Localized damage** (a few boards) — replaced and refinished, blends in.

## What requires replacement

- **Severe cupping** that doesn\'t flatten after 14 days of drying.
- **Crowning** (board centers higher than edges).
- **Mold or rot in subfloor.**
- **Widespread damage** across multiple rooms.

    body: `Most hardwood damage is fixable without replacing boards. Here\'s how the spectrum of repair works.

## Light surface scratches

- **Cause:** pet nails, dragged shoes, light furniture movement.
- **Fix:** finish-only repair. Lightly screen-sand, fill if needed, recoat the affected area or do a screen-and-recoat of the room. Invisible result.
- **Cost:** $200 – $500 for a small area.

## Medium scratches into the stain

- **Cause:** dropped tools, pet damage from a bigger animal, dragged appliance.
- **Fix:** color-matched filler, blended stain touch-up, finish coat. Requires skill but invisible result.
- **Cost:** $300 – $800 depending on area.

## Deep gouges into bare wood

- **Cause:** dropped sharp object, moved heavy furniture without pads.
- **Fix:** wood filler + custom-mixed stain to match the original wood color, then finish coat. Visible from up close; invisible from across the room.
- **Cost:** $400 – $1,000.

## Severe damage requiring board replacement

- **Cause:** chronic pet urine that\'s soaked through, fire damage, deep gouges that can\'t be filled.
- **Fix:** cut out damaged boards, weave in matching new boards, custom-stain to match, refinish surrounding area.
- **Cost:** $500 – $2,500+ depending on board count and matching difficulty.

## Whole-room consideration

If a room has more than 5 – 10 areas of damage, it\'s often more cost-effective to refinish the whole room than to do many spot repairs. The floor will look better and the per-sq-ft cost is similar.

## What we won\'t do

- Take on a spot repair if the surrounding finish is so worn that the patch will stand out. We\'ll recommend a screen-and-recoat or full refinish instead.
- Use mismatched filler that we know won\'t blend.
- Promise invisible results on damage that genuinely can\'t hide.

    alt: 'Hardwood kitchen flooring in an Inland Empire home',
    body: `Kitchens demand flooring that handles water, dropped pans, heat under appliances, and high traffic. Here\'s how the major options handle a real kitchen.

## Our recommendations

**Best overall: Luxury Vinyl Plank.** Fully waterproof, comfortable underfoot, easy to clean, forgiving with dropped pots, looks like wood.

**Best in formal kitchens: Engineered hardwood.** Beautiful, real wood feel. Workable in dry-style kitchens with careful cooks. Risky in family kitchens with frequent spills near a busy dishwasher.

**Best in heavy-cooking kitchens: Tile.** Bulletproof, lasts forever, fully waterproof. Cold underfoot, hard on glassware, hard on legs. Anti-fatigue mats at sink and stove are a must.

## What we see most in Inland Empire kitchens

- **2010s+ slab homes (Fontana, Ontario, Eastvale, newer Rancho):** LVP throughout main floor, including kitchen. Whole-house consistency.
- **Older slab homes (1980s – 2000s):** LVP or tile in kitchen, hardwood in living/dining.
- **Historic raised-foundation homes (Redlands, Riverside):** original hardwood or refinished oak. Sometimes paired with tile inset at sink.
- **Custom homes:** wide-plank engineered hardwood throughout, with rare exception.

## Things to avoid

- **High-gloss anything** in a busy kitchen — every smudge shows.
- **Hardwood directly under the dishwasher** — even careful homes get leaks.
- **Solid hardwood on slab kitchens** — engineered is more stable.
- **Cheap LVP** in a high-traffic kitchen — wear-layer thickness matters.

## Cost ranges

- LVP: $5 – $9 per sq ft installed
- Tile: $10 – $20 per sq ft installed
- Engineered hardwood: $9 – $16 per sq ft installed
- Solid hardwood: $10 – $16 per sq ft installed (raised foundations only)

    alt: 'Waterproof flooring for an Inland Empire bathroom',
    body: `Bathrooms are wet rooms. Standing water on the floor is a daily reality, not an exception. Only two flooring types belong here: tile and waterproof LVP.

## Tile

The traditional and bulletproof choice. Porcelain or natural stone. Lasts decades, fully waterproof, withstands shower splash and tub overflow.

- **Pros:** lifetime durability, fully waterproof, scratch-proof, classic look.
- **Cons:** cold underfoot, hard on dropped items, grout requires periodic sealing.
- **Cost:** $10 – $20 per sq ft installed for porcelain. More for natural stone.

## Waterproof LVP

The modern alternative. Quality SPC or rigid-core LVP is fully waterproof and warmer underfoot than tile.

- **Pros:** waterproof, warm and quiet underfoot, easy install over existing flooring, lower cost.
- **Cons:** can show wear in 15 – 20 years vs tile\'s lifetime; less prestigious than tile in upper-tier homes.
- **Cost:** $5 – $9 per sq ft installed.

## What we don\'t install in full bathrooms

- **Hardwood** — water exposure makes it a poor choice. We have done it for clients who insist; we always advise against.
- **Standard laminate** — only water-resistant, not waterproof. Bathroom water exposure exceeds its tolerance.
- **Carpet** — moisture trap, mildew risk, code issues in some areas.

## Powder rooms (no shower)

Different rules. Powder rooms have minimal water exposure (sink only). LVP, water-resistant laminate, or even hardwood can work depending on aesthetic continuity with adjacent rooms.

## Common pairings

- **Tile in master bath + LVP in secondary baths** — high-end finish where it\'s seen, practical elsewhere.
- **LVP throughout** — modern look, easier maintenance, color-matched to main living areas.
- **Tile on floor + tile on shower walls** — classic and integrated.

    body: `Bedrooms are the easiest rooms to floor — low traffic, no water exposure, minimal heat load. Almost any flooring works. The choice is mostly about aesthetics, budget, and continuity with the rest of the home.

## Top choices

**Hardwood** — premium feel, looks great with any furniture style, refinishable. Best paired with hardwood elsewhere on the floor for visual continuity.

**LVP** — practical, comfortable underfoot with attached pad, easy to clean if pets sleep with you, budget-friendly.

**Laminate** — same upsides as LVP, slightly less premium feel, slightly lower cost.

**Carpet** — yes, still the right choice in some bedrooms. Master bedrooms with no pet access, kids\' rooms, guest rooms. Sound-absorbing, soft underfoot, warm. Just no longer dominant.

## What to consider

- **Whole-floor consistency.** Bedrooms should usually match adjacent hallway flooring. Mismatched flooring at bedroom doorways looks off.
- **Pet access.** If pets sleep on the bed, LVP wins for accident-resistance.
- **Sound concerns.** LVP and laminate can be a touch louder than carpet. Quality underlayment matters.
- **Allergies.** Hard surface flooring is the universal recommendation for allergy-sensitive sleepers. Carpet traps allergens.

## What we install most

- **Whole-house hardwood or wide-plank engineered** — most bedrooms in upper-tier Inland Empire homes today.
- **LVP throughout** — most family homes in mid-tier.
- **Carpet remaining only in formal master bedrooms** in some traditional homes.

## What works below grade

**Luxury Vinyl Plank.** Best basement floor today. Fully waterproof, dimensionally stable, comfortable underfoot, easy install over slab.

**Tile.** Bulletproof. Cold and hard. Lasts forever.

**Engineered hardwood with proper moisture management.** Possible but requires moisture barrier and ongoing humidity control. Generally we\'d steer toward LVP.

**Sealed and stained concrete.** Increasingly popular for utility-style basements. Cost-effective and waterproof.

## What never works below grade

- **Solid hardwood.** Not appropriate for below-grade applications.
- **Standard laminate** — moisture sensitivity disqualifies it.
- **Carpet without major moisture controls** — mold risk too high.

## Why moisture matters more in basements

Even in dry Southern California, slab basements can wick moisture from the surrounding soil. A vapor barrier is essential. Many products require dimple-mat underlayments or specific moisture management systems for warranty coverage.

## What to ask before installing in a basement

- Has the slab been moisture-tested?
- Is the floor product rated for below-grade installation?
- Does the warranty cover below-grade use?
- Is there a vapor barrier in the install plan?

## Our commercial work

- **Small office spaces** (under 5,000 sq ft).
- **Retail boutiques** and showrooms.
- **Restaurants** (front of house) and small cafes.
- **Medical and dental practices** — Loma Linda area especially.
- **Salons and spas.**
- **Tenant improvements** for new leases.

## Best commercial flooring options

**1. Commercial-grade LVP (SPC, 20+ mil wear layer).** Top recommendation. Waterproof, scratch-resistant, easy to clean, fast install, attractive. Glue-down or click-lock depending on space.

**2. AC5 commercial laminate.** Cost-effective for offices and back-of-house. Realistic wood looks.

**3. Hardwood (engineered, 4 – 6 mm wear layer).** Upper-tier showrooms, boutique retail, designer offices. Refinishable, premium feel.

**4. Polished concrete.** Industrial chic look, lowest long-term maintenance, requires existing slab in good condition.

## What we don\'t recommend for commercial

- **Solid hardwood** — refinishability rarely justifies the higher cost vs engineered for commercial use.
- **Residential-grade LVP** — wear layer too thin for commercial traffic.
- **Carpet** — only for sound-sensitive offices or hospitality where it fits the aesthetic.

## Install windows

Most commercial install timelines are tight. We work nights and weekends when needed to minimize business disruption. Click-lock LVP installs especially fast — large open spaces in 2 – 3 days for thousands of square feet.

## Considerations specific to commercial

- **ADA compliance.** Transitions and slip resistance matter.
- **Local building department permits** — we handle.
- **Material warranty terms** for commercial use vary by product.
- **Lease compliance** — landlord approval often required for floor changes.

    body: `The most-asked comparison in residential flooring. Here\'s the honest breakdown.

## Cost

- **Hardwood:** $8 – $16 per sq ft installed.
- **LVP:** $4 – $9 per sq ft installed.
- **Winner:** LVP for budget; depends on priorities at higher tiers.

## Water resistance

- **Hardwood:** poor. Spills wiped quickly are fine; standing water damages.
- **LVP:** fully waterproof. Spills, accidents, dishwasher leaks all fine.
- **Winner:** LVP, decisively.

## Durability against scratches

- **Hardwood:** scratches from pet nails, furniture, dropped objects. Refinishable.
- **LVP:** wear-layer-resistant scratches. Quality LVP handles pet nails well.
- **Winner:** LVP for resistance; hardwood for recovery (refinishing).

## Lifespan

- **Hardwood:** 75 – 100+ years with refinishing along the way.
- **LVP:** 15 – 30 years residential.
- **Winner:** Hardwood, by a lot.

## Resale value

- **Hardwood:** premium signal in real estate listings, especially in mid-to-upper price points.
- **LVP:** acceptable, not premium. Doesn\'t hurt; doesn\'t help significantly.
- **Winner:** Hardwood in $500K+ markets.

## Look and feel

- **Hardwood:** real wood — texture, warmth, feel underfoot, character that develops over years.
- **LVP:** good imitation; modern premium LVP is increasingly close. Still recognizable as not real wood up close.
- **Winner:** Hardwood, but the gap has narrowed significantly.

## Install time

- **Hardwood:** 3 – 7 days including acclimation.
- **LVP:** 1 – 3 days, no cure time.
- **Winner:** LVP.

## When to choose hardwood

- Long-term home (10+ years).
- Raised foundation or willing to do engineered on slab.
- Mid-to-upper tier home where resale matters.
- No major water exposure.
- Aesthetic priority over practicality.

## When to choose LVP

- Pet households, especially big dogs.
- Wet rooms (kitchens, bathrooms, laundry).
- Rental properties.
- Budget-priority installs.
- Slab homes where engineered hardwood would also work but LVP is simpler.

## Mixed approach (most common today)

Hardwood (or engineered) in living/dining/bedrooms + LVP in kitchens/baths/laundry. Color-matched. Best of both.

    body: `Hardwood and laminate occupy different price and quality tiers. Here\'s how they compare on what actually matters.

## Cost

- **Hardwood:** $8 – $16 per sq ft installed.
- **Laminate:** $3 – $7 per sq ft installed.
- **Difference:** Laminate is roughly half the cost.

## Authenticity

- **Hardwood:** real wood. The actual material in your floor.
- **Laminate:** photo of wood under a clear wear layer. Increasingly realistic; still not real wood.

## Refinishability

- **Hardwood:** can be sanded and refinished 4 – 7 times (solid) or 2 – 4 times (engineered).
- **Laminate:** cannot be refinished. Photo wear layer is finished at the factory and replaced when worn.

## Lifespan

- **Hardwood:** 75 – 100+ years.
- **Laminate:** 15 – 25 years residential.

## Water resistance

- **Hardwood:** poor.
- **Laminate:** water-resistant cores available. Better than hardwood, worse than LVP. Don\'t use in full bathrooms.

## Sound underfoot

- **Hardwood:** solid, dense sound.
- **Laminate:** can sound hollow without quality underlayment. Feels less premium underfoot.

## Resale value impact

- **Hardwood:** "real hardwood throughout" is a listing remark.
- **Laminate:** neutral to slightly negative in upper-tier markets; acceptable in mid and budget tiers.

## When to choose hardwood

- You can budget for it.
- Long-term home where refinishability extends value.
- Mid-to-upper tier home.
- Aesthetic priority.

## When to choose laminate

- Budget is the priority and LVP isn\'t available within budget.
- Short-to-medium term hold (5 – 10 years).
- Dry rooms only (avoid full bathrooms).
- Rental properties (though we usually steer to LVP).

## Honest middle path: LVP

For most homeowners considering laminate today, we recommend looking at LVP at the same price point. It\'s often slightly more expensive but the waterproof advantage is meaningful, and the visuals have largely converged.

    alt: 'Engineered and solid hardwood comparison',
    body: `Both engineered and solid are real hardwood. Same wood, same look, same finish. The difference is structural — and it matters.

## Construction

- **Solid:** one piece of hardwood, 3/4" thick, tongue-and-groove.
- **Engineered:** wear layer of real hardwood (1 – 6 mm) on a multi-ply plywood core. Total thickness 1/2" – 5/8".

## Refinishability

- **Solid:** 4 – 7 full refinishes possible over the floor\'s lifetime.
- **Engineered with 4 – 6 mm wear layer:** 2 – 4 refinishes possible.
- **Engineered with 1 – 2 mm wear layer:** cannot be refinished; replaced at end of life.

## Subfloor compatibility

- **Solid:** nail-down to plywood subfloor only. Cannot install over slab without significant prep.
- **Engineered:** floats, glues down, or nails. Works over slab — the dominant choice for post-1990 Inland Empire homes.

## Plank widths

- **Solid:** stable up to about 4" – 5". Wider widths are prone to cupping in our climate.
- **Engineered:** stable at 6" – 9" wide planks. The reason wide-plank floors are almost always engineered.

## Cost

- **Solid:** $9 – $16 per sq ft installed.
- **Engineered:** $9 – $18 per sq ft installed (wider range due to wear-layer variation).
- **Winner:** Comparable at similar quality tiers.

## Lifespan

- **Solid:** 75 – 100+ years with refinishing.
- **Engineered (premium):** 30 – 50 years with refinishing.
- **Engineered (budget):** 15 – 20 years.

## Climate stability in the Inland Empire

- **Solid:** more sensitive to humidity swings. Requires whole-house humidifier and tight humidity control.
- **Engineered:** plywood core resists movement. More forgiving of humidity variation.

## When to choose solid

- Raised-foundation home.
- Long-term ownership (decades).
- Aesthetic priority on traditional 2-1/4" – 5" plank widths.
- Historic home where solid is appropriate.

## When to choose engineered

- Slab subfloor (most newer Inland Empire homes).
- Want wider planks (5"+).
- Variable humidity rooms.
- Below-grade application.

## What we install most

- **Older raised-foundation homes:** solid hardwood, refinish or new.
- **Newer slab homes:** wide-plank engineered hardwood.
- **Custom and upper-tier homes:** wide-plank European oak engineered.
