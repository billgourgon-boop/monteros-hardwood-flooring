      { q: 'What\'s the difference between AC ratings?', a: 'AC ratings measure wear-layer durability. AC3 = light residential, AC4 = heavy residential / light commercial, AC5 = heavy commercial. For a busy family home with kids and pets, we recommend AC4 minimum.' },
      { q: 'Can laminate be refinished?', a: 'No - the photographic wear layer is finished at the factory and can\'t be sanded. When it eventually wears out (usually 15 – 25 years), it gets replaced. The good news: the install cost is low, so replacement is reasonable.' },
